### Work Done

    Release of the Retriever Data Retriever2.2.0
    Add spatial data support to Retriever
    Update the Julia package Retriever.jl to support spartial data processing
    Testing on Docker to support PostGis installation for spatial data processing testing
    Google summer of code mentoring (2018)
      - Rdataretriever to use the Python interface through reticulate
      - Retrieverdash a dashboard to keep track of the retriever dataset

#### Main elements

    Add spatial support to the retriever and related projects
    Transition to the more stable, testing environment using Dockers to support spatial extension installations

#### upgrades

    Use the Data Retriever Python interface for Rdataretiever through reticulate
    Use the Docker environment, currently on Rdataretiever and Retriever.jl
   
#### Misc

Maintaining [swcarpentry/sql-novice-survey](https://github.com/swcarpentry/sql-novice-survey)
Developed in-house test platform to Utilize the HPC(HiPerGator) but I was limited by the permissions

#### workshops

1. SwampHacks [2019 (Mentor) ](http://2019.swamphacks.com/) and 2018
2. Instructor Training [helper March 5-6 , 2018) ](https://fmichonneau.github.io/2018-03-05-UF-ttt/)

### Work to Do:

#### **Weaver**

Release Weaver 1.0 (This has been delayed for a very long time)

##### Core Parts features:

    Adding tests for tabular datasets
    Adding tests for spatial datasets
    Cleaning up code and refactoring
    Adding sample data packages, looking at Google datasets
    Add spatial support for SQLite (Under Testing and will be incorporated after PostGis tests)
    Publish Weaver Software under Joss

Note: Most of the work needed for the Weaver required a better tuning of the underlying APIs / Environments.

#### **Retreiver**

    Introduce recipes for scripts
    Add tools to help with script creating from raw data 

*Data Retriever*

    Adding tests for spatial datasets

*conda Retriever*

    Update retriever-feedstock for each retriever release

*Retriever.jl*
 
    Publish Retriever.jl Software under Joss
    New version release (current v0.0.1)
        The new version will include the Spatial data support on Postgis
    Adding tests for spatial datasets (PostGis on Docker installed)

*Rdataretriever*


    Release new version v1.1.0 (current v1.0.0)
        The new version will include the spatial data support on Postgis
    Adding tests for spatial datasets (PostGis on Docker installed)
    Publish rdataretriever Software under Joss

*Retrieverdash*

    The Retrieverdash needs to be run on a server with enough storage
    
##### Google summer Code:

    To be updated https://github.com/weecology/retriever/wiki/GSoC-2019-Project-Ideas

### Completing this phase

**Weaver**

    Note: This has been on the list for 3 years. 2016, 2017, 2018 

    The initial development supported several database systems using Sqlalchemy.
    The Initial focus was to have datasets integrated regardless of their storage platforms (DBMS).
    With the introduction of Data packages for Frictionless data and the limited Database support for Spatial data, 
    We redesigned the code and scaled down to Postgres and Sqlite.
    We rely on the Data Retriever API for cleaning up data sets and installing these datasets into the supported databases.
    
    I am confident that with most of the uplifting we have done, we shall have the software released in a more stable state
    This is due to the following factors mentioned below
    
    - Spatial data installation is available in the Data Retriever environment
    - Testing has been made easier and manageable using Dockers to test with spatial extension for current DBMS
    - Better and Improved Weaver script definition has been built.
    - Spatial and tabular test cases are being built and tested / added for the Weaver and currently in a clean up process

###### Misc Projects

    -

* __What are your long-term career plans?__

    `Become better at project management, explore more programming languages.`
   
* __Given your long-term plans, what do you think you need to do to be successful?__

    `I plan to explore and use some of the university's resources that relate to project management and probably a few more Computer Science courses.`

* __What did you accomplish this year towards accomplishing your goals?__

    `I have managed to keep up with core algorithm designs through online materials and practice.
 I attended/audited a course on Computer graphics with emphasis on image processing, 
 this was taken by one of our software engineers too.`

* __What are your plans for next year for working towards your goals? (Be as specific as you can be. Are there particular projects you plan to start/finish? Is there specific training or experiences you think you need to succeed in reaching your goals?)__

    `I would like to start taking/auditing a few courses in management or certificates, these may mainly be online.`  

###### Goals for the Retriever:

    Add datasets for the Retriever and publish the Retrieverdash board
    Present a Poster at Scipy 2019

###### Goals for the Weaver:

    Release the first version of the Weaver, supporting Spatial support on PostGis.
    Add more data to the Weaver
