    Add fetch function to enable easy addition of HDF5
    Add HDF5 Engine

##### Weaver

    Release of Weaver 1.0 (With spatial support)
    
##### Google summer Code:

    Mentoring (Adding a Retriever Dashboard and imporving the R package)

### Completing this phase

#### Development:


##### Retriever

    Implementating the DashBoard and improve the R package.(By the end of Summer 2018)
    The spacial support for PostgreSQL/PostGIS, SQLite/SpatiaLite and probably MySQL

##### Weaver:

    To release the Weaver 1.0.

###### Misc Projects

    Build an in-house test platform.
    The Goal is to create an in-house test platform to Utilize the HPC(HiPerGator)resource
    for some of the projects that need a huge a mount of computing resources and time.

* __What are your long-term career plans?__

**_Software development_**

    `I am working towards improving my software development and data science skills. My appraoch has been going through new and revisiting old algorithm and data structures designs and problems.`

In the previous evaluation year, I have looked at how companies organize and manage some of the project. The biggest part of the learning was to keep up with the new trends on software architecture. I have also been visiting a class on Computer graphics which focuses on the fundamental algorithms used for image processing.

For this evaluation year, I want to focus on getting familiar with a few more languages and development frameworks.

**_Reseach outreach_**

    `I was successful in helping some of the students in Africa join the capentry instructor program. However, I am still working towards getting more people involved in the these organisations as a path towards improving research in third word countries. This has not been easy, but it is an area I wish I could help more`

From the previous year we managed to present the progress in an article/publication entitled `Growing a Data-Ready Continent: Every Contribution Counts`. This year I am working on getting students in Africa to join open source projects, and competitions like Mozilla Science, GSoC and Kaggle compettions.



* __Given your long-term plans, what do you think you need to do to be successful?__

    `Creating networks with organizations developing great tools especially on open platforms. I have been looking at some of the open source software developmet code with a goal of learning something new.`

Networking has been part of my activities in the previous evaluation year. I did find great people at some of the meetups I attended. For example the Scipy conference where I interacted with people on how they organize their development workflows and I did share my experience with some of the folks. At the SwampHacks, I was privileged to be a Mentor and discussed various new trends with Mentors who were from the industry.


* __What did you accomplish this year towards accomplishing your goals?__

    `I have managed to keep up with core algorithm designs and still learning new ones
    I revisited and attended some of the topics in Machine learning class offered by Nikolay Bliznyuk at UF/IFAS
    Mentoring a few students in Kenya and South Africa as they took the instructor training courses
    I made some small contributions to open source repositories as part of the efforts to improve the Data retriever
    pyinstaller/pyinstaller
    ContributorCovenant/contributor_covenant`

Most of the work accomplished has been on redesigning the core retriever package to enable handling of the spatial data. The Weaver relies fundamentally on the capabilities of the Data Retriever to import spatial data. Currently, we are finalizing the  testing of Raster data injection. This will speed up development on the weaver.
    
    __others small contibutions__
    
    Contribution to the Capentries(Maintainer).
    Contributions to the Frictionless Data Specs


* __What are your plans for next year for working towards your goals? (Be as specific as you can be. Are there particular projects you plan to start/finish? Is there specific training or experiences you think you need to succeed in reaching your goals?)__

    `My main goal of this year is to incoperate spacial data to both the Data retriever and Weaver.
    By the end of summer we shall have working prototypes of the data retriever spacial support of PostgreSQL/PostGIS, SQLite/SpatiaLite and the Weaver with HDF support`

Getting spatial support for vector data on Postgres and Sqlite


###### Goals for the Retriever:

    `Previously, I wanted to include as many datasets as posible.
    However, the goal is providing a platform where any type of data could be supported easily(plug and use).`

This is still a work in progress that I do think would be taken on during summer 2019. With the undergoing testing on Raster support for Postgis and a good platform for handling tabular datasets. I think we shall have the right resources to add more dataset to the retriever(Both tabular and spatial). We have greatly improved the data retriever to handle tabular data and introduced processing Data packages. We do still have some work to do in that area since the packages specs are still being developed. By developed, I mean the updates always break the code. As the package specifications become more stable, we shall have a more stable design to follow.

###### Goals for the Weaver:

    `Relaese 1.0(I am behind schedule due to challenges that I under looked when working on the retriever)`
