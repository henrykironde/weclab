### Work Done
#### Main elements

1. Data Retriever: Add support for more raw data formats In this project the retriever eco system can process raw data in the formats; 
```
Completed and tested across all platforms, Retriever, Retriever.jl, Rdataretriever
XML, JSON, HDF, Excel, Geojson, Sqlite
```
`_NetCDF , **On going. We looking for more data_`


2. Improve environment setup and installation on all platforms for all Data Retriever ecosystem services
3. Add support for Kaggle


#### Releases
Retriever v3.0.0
rdataretriever  Version: 3.0.0 (_cran_), v3.0.1. (_GitHub_)
Retriever.jl v1.0.0

#### Misc

1. Improve code style and add CI test for the code style
2. Improve `autocreate` for spatial datasets and add `autocreate` documentation
3. Redesign `Deepforest` package and the change the doc setup
4. Update version of `Julia `syntax and package management setup for `Retriever.jl `
5. Ongoing - Add support for Frictionless data.(Note: _We setup the required tools but the data was no consistent in the specifications used._)

#### Workshops / Conferences
 Google Summer of Code 2020 Mentor Summit - _How do we get more diversity in our community?_

## Work to Do 2021:

#### **PydataWeaver**

Add scripts related to Macro systems. (Currently I am adding Macro system datasets to the retriever. These are expected to be used by the PydataWeaver)
 
### **Retreiver Eco System**

#### Data Retriever

**GSOC:** 
1. Data Retriever: Add Data Packages
    -  The goal is to scale the data coverage to most public data like `.gov` datasets. We shall use current data compilation services as a measure of achievement.
       **Point of comparison**
        Google datasets. AWS datasets. (They do provide links to the data but do no standardization of the dataset)
        Note, _Reference data sources like Friction less data are not applicable because of our growth in comparison_   
    
2. Data Retriever: Support for Login/API
    - Drive to include API support and Login support to data sources
3. Data Retriever: Update the retriever-dashboard
    - As we aim for more datasets, we shall need to make sure that the dashboard continuously  test all the datasets and reports back the datasets that are failing or those that have changed. This will be a great way to manage the software, and provide details easily to the users/scientist who are looking for clean ready to download datasets. 
 
#### Expected releases
Retriever **v3.0.1, and v3.0.2**
rdataretriever  `Version: 3.0.2`
Retriever.jl `v1.0.1` 
Update conda packages
### Completing this phase
**PydataWeaver** 
- Expect new scripts (number not yet determined)
##### Retrievers
    - Expect to have tests running for all datasets on the retriever-dashboard
    - Support for Login/API
    - More data packages(Metrics for performance not yet established)
###### Misc Projects
    - Deepforeset to Deepforest-pytorch
    - Portal services and products
