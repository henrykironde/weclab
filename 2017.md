__Henry Senyondo, Annual self self-assessment (Spring 2017)__

__1. :__


### Work Done

    Release of retriever as Data Retriever2.0.0
    Google summer of code mentoring(2016 summer project Python 2/3)
 
    
##### Main elements

    Python 2 and 3
    Added a consistent Encoding scheme
    SQL inserting multiple records 
    Added json and xml engines
    Adition of json data package
    Expansion of integration testing and Pytest
    Shift to csv module for preprocessing of data
    Added afew machine Learning datasets from UC Irvine's machine learning data sets
    Improve versioning system for scripts so as to keep track of the script changes
    Improve user experience(progress bars, displayed statments)
    Add appveyor 
    
###### upgrades

    Use pyinstaller for creating exe for windows and remove py2app
    Add pre commit hook
    Add a retriever minimum version for datasets
    Improve documentation
    
###### Misc

    Add code of conduct
    Include Data retiever to list of the software utilizing the Contributor Covenant
 
    
###### workshops

    1) Moore Early Career Researcher Symposium(January 17-21, 2017)
    2) Research Software Engineers (RSEs) Conference 2016 
    3) Software Carpentry Workshop(orginizer/helper Mar 24-25, 2016)
    
###### Posters

    Henry Senyondo and Ethan P. White (2016). The Data Retriever: A package manager for other people’s data presented at the first conference of Research Software Engineers (RSE17)
    
###### Awards

    RSE17 Best Poster award with travel award(£250) Research Software Engineers Conference 2017 (Henry Senyondo)


### Work to Do:


##### Retreiver

    Adding Python Interface and Command Line wrapper for Retriever in Julia
    Add Spatial Data Support to the Data Retriever
    
###### Core Parts features:

    Python Interface
    Import Spacial Data
    HDF5 Engine
    
##### Weaver

    Release of Weaver 1.0 (Remaining with incoperation HDF,vector spacial support and Re-designing)
    
##### Google summer Code:

    Mentoring (Adding spacial capabilities and Julia interface)
    
### Completing this phase

Development:

    
##### Retriever (By the end of Summer 2017)

    Due to Gsoc's timeline(Goodle summer fo code), We shall have the python inteface and spacial data features included by the end of Summer
    The spacial support for PostgreSQL/PostGIS, SQLite/SpatiaLite and probably MySQL will be supported by the data retriever
    
    
##### Weaver: 

    To release the Weaver 1.0 we still have to add HDF support by the end of Summer.
    We have added non complex spacial raster data support. We have to add vector spacial support
    

* __What are your long-term career plans?__
        
**_Software development_**

    I am working towards improving my software development and data science skills. My appraoch has been going through new and revisiting old algorithm and data structures designs and problems.

**_Reseach outreach_**

    I was successful in helping some of the students in Africa join the capentry instructor program. However, I am still working towards getting more people involved in the these organisations as a path towards improving research in third word countries.
    This has not been easy, but it is an area I wish I could help more

* __Given your long-term plans, what do you think you need to do to be successful?__

    Creating networks with organizations developing great tools especially on open platforms. I have been looking at some of the open source software developmet code with a goal of learning something new.

* __What did you accomplish this year towards accomplishing your goals?__

    I have managed to keep up with core algorithm designs and still learning new ones
    I revisited and attended some of the topics in Machine learning class offered by Nikolay Bliznyuk at UF/IFAS
    Mentoring a few students in Kenya and South Africa as they took the instructor training courses
    I made some small contributions to open source repositories as part of the efforts to improve the Data retriever
    pyinstaller/pyinstaller
    ContributorCovenant/contributor_covenant
    
    __others small contibutions__
    
    RaRe-Technologies/gensim
    numfocus/gsoc 


* __What are your plans for next year for working towards your goals? (Be as specific as you can be. Are there particular projects you plan to start/finish? Is there specific training or experiences you think you need to succeed in reaching your goals?)__

    My main goal of this year is to incoperate spacial data to both the Data retriever and Weaver.
    By the end of summer we shall have working prototypes of the data retriever spacial support of PostgreSQL/PostGIS, SQLite/SpatiaLite and the Weaver with HDF support
   
###### Goals for the Retriever:

    Previously, I wanted to include as many datasets as posible.
    However, the goal is providing a platform where any type of data could be supported easily(plug and use).

###### Goals for the Weaver:

    Relaese 1.0(I am behind schedule due to challenges that I under looked when working on the retriever)

 __2.  It should be written down. This gives you a record next year of what you thought you needed to be doing so you can compare what you did with what you wanted to do.__
 
Done

__3. Share it with us. This is totally voluntary, but we know a little bit about succeeding in academia and we know a lot of people who work in other areas of science (and software engineering). Our goal is to help you be successful in whatever career path you choose. Knowing what you want to do, what you think you need in order to do it, and what you want to accomplish helps us advise you better during your weekly meetings.__

Done
